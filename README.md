Step 2: Building a Chatbot Framework for Response Processing

Step 3: Creating a Graphical Interface

app.py (for the graphical user interface)

chat.py (for building a chatbot framework)

intents.json (helping the computer understand the intents)

model.py (a few lines of code integrating the deep learning components)

nltk_utils.py (for the natural language processing with nltk and other libraries)

train.py (for the training of the program itself!)
