# Inspiration:

As students of information technology and machine learning we were inspired to use our skills to make a positive impact on mental health. We decided to build a chatbot that could provide information and support to those struggling with mental health conditions.

# What it does:

We gathered a dataset of mental health-related information, including common conditions, treatments, and resources. We then used this dataset to train a natural language processing (NLP) model, which would allow the chatbot to understand and respond to user inputs. We chose to use a pre-trained language model such as GPT-3 and fine-tuned it on my dataset to improve its performance.

# HOPE Dataset:

HOPE contains 202 dyadic counselling conversation transcripts. Each utterance is tagged with a dialogue-act. This dataset is best suited to design many NLP tasks (apart from dialogue-act classification) for mental health care.

# How we built it:

We integrated the NLP model with a chatbot platform such as Dialogflow or Botkit, to handle user inputs and generate responses. We also incorporated machine learning (ML) techniques, such as sentiment analysis, to better understand the user's emotional state and provide more personalized support.

# Challenges we ran into:

One of the biggest challenges we faced was finding a way to clearly convey that the chatbot was not a substitute for professional medical advice and that users should seek professional help if they are in crisis. To address this, we included a disclaimer at the beginning of the chatbot's conversation and made sure to include resources for professional help throughout the chatbot's responses.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of:

Successfully gathered a comprehensive dataset of mental health-related information, including common conditions, treatments, and resources. Trained a natural language processing (NLP) model on the dataset, allowing the chatbot to understand and respond to user inputs effectively.

# What we learned:

Through building this chatbot, we learned about the importance of accessible mental health resources, the potential for chatbots to provide support in this area, and the challenges of developing a conversational AI. We hope that this chatbot can help those struggling with mental health conditions find the information and support they need.

# What's next for Chatbot For Mental Health:

There are several next steps that can be taken to further improve and expand the chatbot for mental health. Some potential ideas include:

Continuously updating and expanding the dataset to ensure that the chatbot has the most current and accurate information on mental health conditions, treatments, and resources. Incorporating more advanced machine learning techniques, such as deep learning, to improve the chatbot's ability to understand and respond to user inputs. Integrating the chatbot with other platforms, such as social media or messaging apps, to make it more accessible to a wider audience. Adding new features to the chatbot, such as a symptom checker or a journaling feature, to provide additional support and resources to users. Conducting user testing and gathering feedback to improve the chatbot's performance and user experience. Providing more resources for professional help, that are easily accessible for the users. Overall, there is a lot of potential for this chatbot to make a positive impact on mental health and there are many ways to continue to develop and improve it.

# IMPLEMENTATION

Step 1: Transforming Conversational Intents and Definitions to a Pytorch Model

Step 2: Building a Chatbot Framework for Response Processing

Step 3: Creating a Graphical Interface

app.py (for the graphical user interface)

chat.py (for building a chatbot framework)

intents.json (helping the computer understand the intents)

model.py (a few lines of code integrating the deep learning components)

nltk_utils.py (for the natural language processing with nltk and other libraries)

train.py (for the training of the program itself!)
